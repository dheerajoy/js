## Abstraction

Abstraction hides complex details and shows only the necessary features of an object. In JavaScript, abstraction can be achieved by providing a clean interface through methods, while the internal implementation is hidden.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is about bundling the data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit (object/class), and restricting direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components.

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This helps in code reuse and creating a hierarchical structure.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance. It enables methods in the child classes to override methods in the parent class.
